When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
 - when collaborating with others on the project
 - when you seek to co contribute to a public project
 - when you want to share your code with others
 - when you want to access your work from multiple machines with ease
 
 ------------------------------------------------
 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
 
 - because you may have made changes locally that would be incompatible with the remote changes
 - because you would have to manually resolve conflicts each time
 - because the latest version may offer features/changes that you are simply not interested in or that don't work properly on your machine
