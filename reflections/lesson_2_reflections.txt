What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

 - Initalizing a repository means that all the necessary meta information files are created by Git
 - Without these meta data git wouldn't know what revision you're at, how to compare changes, which files to exclude, etc.
------------------------------------------------

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

 - The staging area let's you gather all the files that should be pushed to the next commit.
 - Your working directory contains all the latest files, including changes you made yourself.
 - The repository has fixed snapshots of all relevant files.
 - Having a staging area means you can commit only those files that you really wish to update. So you can play/mess around with everything and then only stage the files that merrit a change. It allows for atomic (?) commits!
 
------------------------------------------------
How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

 - Add only those files that concern the logical change to the staging area, then commit with a descriptive message
 - Use git diff (without arguments) to see all changes that have not been staged yet
 - Use git diff --staged to compare staging area to HEAD revision

------------------------------------------------
What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

 - building and trying out experimental features
 - multiple languages/localizations for the same project
 - when preparing a major redesign/relaunch (keep the MASTER branch with the current version)
 - (design) decisions that are incompatible with one another
 - when making personal modifications to a public project

------------------------------------------------
How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

 - see the different branches that exist
 - see where HEAD currently is
 - track history of new branches (when did they get added?)
 - see development of branches over time

------------------------------------------------
What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?

 - the result will contain the latest files of both branches
 - the graphical representation in a diagram shows that both branches have common origin from which they deviated
 as well as now common 'future'
 - often smaller experimental changes are merged into the main/master branch when they work and prove useful

------------------------------------------------
What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?

 - automatic merging is faster and safe if branches made changes to completely unrelated matters
 - automatic merging may produce redundand code
 - manual merging allows you to control the exact changes, but it's also tedious
