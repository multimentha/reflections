What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

 - Initalizing a repository means that all the necessary meta information files are created by Git
 - Without these meta data git wouldn't know what revision you're at, how to compare changes, which files to exclude, etc.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

 - The staging area let's you gather all the files that should be pushed to the next commit.
 - Your working directory contains all the latest files, including changes you made yourself.
 - The repository has fixed snapshots of all relevant files.
 - Having a staging area means you can commit only those files that you really wish to update. So you can play/mess around with everything and then only stage the files that merrit a change. It allows for atomic (?) commits!
